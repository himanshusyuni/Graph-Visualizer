# Graph Visualizer

Graph Visualizer is a web application that allows users to create and visualize graphs (both weighted and unweighted) by inputting nodes and edges. The application also provides functionalities to explore various graph algorithms, with documentation and visual representations of their workings.

## Features

- **Graph Creation**: Users can input nodes and edges to create a custom graph.
- **Weighted and Unweighted Graphs**: Users can select whether the graph is weighted or unweighted.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: The application includes multiple graph algorithms, each with detailed documentation and the ability to visualize their execution on the graph.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create, modify, and visualize graphs.

## Usage

### Creating a Graph

1. **Input Nodes**:
   - Enter the number of nodes you want to include in your graph.

2. **Input Edges**:
   - Specify the edges between the nodes. For weighted graphs, also provide the weight for each edge.

3. **Select Graph Type**:
   - Choose whether the graph is weighted or unweighted.

### Visualizing Algorithms

1. **Select an Algorithm**:
   - Toggle to Algo section
   - Choose from a list of supported algorithms.

2. **Read Documentation**:
   - Each algorithm comes with detailed documentation explaining its purpose, steps, and applications.

3. **View Algorithm Execution**:
   - Visualize the algorithm’s execution on the created graph. This helps in understanding how the algorithm processes the graph.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Shortest Path Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)**: Finds the strongly connected components in a directed graph.
